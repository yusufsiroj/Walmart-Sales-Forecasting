# Walmart Sales Forecasting
# Problem :
Sales can vary greatly from the average during different seasons, and not being aware of these fluctuations can result in significant financial losses for a company. The ability to predict future sales is essential for any business, as it allows for proper stock management, revenue calculation, and informed decision-making regarding investments. Furthermore, being able to anticipate sales can positively impact stock prices and investor confidence by meeting or exceeding predetermined targets. Conversely, failing to reach projected sales targets can have a detrimental effect on stock prices, particularly for a large company like Walmart. Therefore, understanding and forecasting sales is crucial for the success and stability of a business.
# My Goal:
My main goal in this project is to construct a model that can accurately forecast the sales of the stores. By utilizing this model, Walmart executives will be able to make informed decisions about their future strategies, a crucial aspect in managing inventory, projecting revenue, and determining whether to pursue new investments.
